Predicting Thermostability of Enzyme Variants
=========================================================================

Pol Arranz-Gibert, Ayush Khaitan, Richard van Krieken, and Erika Ordog (Team Pine for the Erdos Institute).

Background
----------
Enzymes, which are long chains of units called amino acids, require a suitable temperature to function. Beyond a certain temperature, called the melting temperature, they get denatured and lose their functionality. Although this temperature can be experimentally determined, it would be tremendously useful for bench side scientists and biotech companies to be able to predict this melting temperature from just the amino acid sequence.


Data
-------
The data set was provided by Novozymes as part of the Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction competition on Kaggle. It consists of the melting temperatures (Tm) and enzyme sequences for approximately 30,000 enzymes.
